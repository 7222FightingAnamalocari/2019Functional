Team 7222 FRC functional code for 2019

This is the functioning code for FRC team 7222 in the 2019 Deep Space Competition
The code is written in Java and uses the iterative robot setup. It has the ability to use 1 camera,
4 drive motors, and 1 Joystick off the bat. Our code can be adapted to your using purposes if you
can/want to.

If you have no idea what is going on either A, go to a psychologist or a doctor. Or B, navigate to the code by following the path that starts on src. But if A, or B are true you probably wouldn't understand, or care
to understand the code in the first place.

for any damages. But we do send our apologies.
